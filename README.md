How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

To interpret user needs and incorporate them in a program I look at the requirements and review and analyze them. I made a list of all the validations required and gave myself a check list to work off of. The next thing I did was map out my code with pseudocode or diagrams so I could understand the flow of the programming and how objects interacted befor planning out what methods I would need to implement before moving on to actual coding.

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

To ensure my code was secure and functional I used unit testing with junit 5 maintaining high coverage percentages to ensure that the code functioned as intended and no errors persisted. For security I tried to utilize encapsulation so that objects werent accesible to the user to prevent the leakage of data.

How do I approach designing software?

When designing software C try to utilize good programming methods as mentioned above like reviewing requirements, creating diagrams, and pseudocode so I have a good understanding of the task at hand before I ever begin writing code. This method helps me write code with a clear purpose and goals in mind and speeds up the end process for me. I also plan to utilize testing more frequently now that I am adept in the benefit it has when coding.
